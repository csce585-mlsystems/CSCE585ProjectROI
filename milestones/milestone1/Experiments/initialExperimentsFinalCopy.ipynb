    "For this milestone, our baseline model is a simple MLP (MultiLayer Perception) classifier traned on the Strategy 1 stock dataset.\n",
    "The input features are engineered financial metrics (like investment amount, investment goal, and time frame), and the target label\n",
    "is an \"optimality\" class indicating whether a stock meets the criteria of Strategy 1.\n",
    "The baseline MLP uses a default configuation of hidden units, dropout, and batch size. \n",
    "Its main role is to establish a refrence level of preformance so that later experiemnts (hyperparameter tuning, quantization changes, and different preprocessing) can be compared back to this baseline.\n",
    "In each experiment's conclusion, we refer to whether the set up is expected to perform better or worse than the baseline model.   "

    "# Reports: [10/23/25] part 1) At this point, finished writing abstract rep of how prog will acheive goal. Started using a functional prog format to acheive goals. In next sesh, focus should be on finishing up setting up coding env programatically FIRST, and then inserting the neccessary pandas stuff, whilst simulatnatneously doing more research on pandas as well. part 2) Continued learning pandas stuff, and continued seting up code env programatically. In next sesh, continue the aforementioned process. When significant prog is made, begin inserting code related to data engineering. Also, when establishing pipeline this search query may be useful: `start chrome \"? is the relative path for a filepath in python script relative to the place it is executed?\"`. [10/24/25] part 1) Continued seting of programmatic env. At this point, I believe Subssytem2's programmatic rep should be worked on next, whilst simulataneously implementing more pandas-specific code. part 2) Continued working on programming code. Adhere to aforemetioend request for next session. part 3) Starting setting up Subsystem2's programmatic representation. In next sesh, make sure to implement a quick algo that seraches for the right table to pull from both the real-time data and the historical data, in addition to the aforementioned tasks from previous report(s). part 4) Started process for integrating external dataframes. Did not adhere to aformentioned objs directly. In next sesh, make sure to adhere to aformentioned objectives. part 5) Started wriritng logic code to facilitate optimality algo. Also worked on algo for obtaining the right attrs from the Ticker Object. In next sesh, take time to finish up Pandas tutorial. part 6) Continued where I left off. In next sesh, start testing out certain portions of program. part 7) Got the algorithms implemented, began testingg parts of program. Now, the only problem is having the varaibels reference the right columns. These places are marked with REPLACEMENT PENDING. In next sesh, go back to learning some more pandas and then work on finishing up the rest of the stuff. May be wise to jump to Time Series data chapter from Python for Data Analysis Textbook to interface with dates properly.\n",
    "# Reports: [10/26/25] part 1) Made more progress by fixing contents relative to error. Had to put the dataframes needd into the python list to be accessed later in the script. In next sesh, continue this process and addresss the 'REPLACEMENT PENDING' notes and make neccessary replacements. part 2) Added a few more things. Added nomenclature for documentation w.r.t comments, to ease the process of problem solving. Addressed a few of the requirements. part 2) Started testing other stuff. Didn't do anything related to time series learning for pandas. In next sesh, focus on learning pandas from geeksforgeeks and going through times series chapter from that textbook. Then, finish this file to integrate to model with this egnienered dataset. Also, there is an error, use code output for reference. part 3) Found some logistical issues wiht some parts. Started process of getting 2nd cond implemented. Really, want to get this proj finished by end of 10/27/25 to get a decent grade.  [10/27/25] part 1) Worked on outermost pipeline script. Going forward, working in reverse order from end of data prep pipeline to beginning to ensure that the nested function(s) and function(s) work properly. part 2) Have some issues getting condition 2. part 3) Got dataframe for condition 2. Think now I need to designate the date. Will be KEY for making decisions. part 3) Made a decent amount of progress. Used comments to update some steps that need to be taken in order to ensure smooth integartion between data prep and model development. In next sesh, continue solving problems to get data prepped for model dev. Particularly, write code that applys the subsystems iteratively to each company. part 4) got subsystem1(compA()) complete, in terms of logic. However, will be imperative to handle presence of null values and omitting them when possible. **PN: I believe it has something to do with the fact that the indices for the row tuples is date-based**. In next sesh, continue to the subsystem2 to ensure that they work logically. part 5) Started working on logic for subsys2. Noticed that I need to handle the creation of dataframe with all companies on it properly. Need to figure out how to do that in subsys2. [10/29/25] part 1) Got the class for subsy2 indented properly for testing. In next sesh, continue runnign tests to ensure that subsy2's components work properly.  [10/31/25] part 1) Started working more on model file to facilitate process for running experiments via Model pipeline. In Next sesh, continue learning more about pandas, and datetime object so you can sync up the times properly to get values lined up to get perimissible data output. Also, may want to make time working on reasons why these milestone were so late. [11/7/25] part 1) Made significant progress. Finally understanding debugging process better now. **Focus is now shifting more towards experimental setups, and creating environment to load images to web application**. \n",

    "# Notable things: a) This search query specifies that it's possible to access attributes for a class. THis allows me to programatically identify the stuff that I need opposed to doing things brute force: `start chrome \"? is there a list of attribues for a particular class in Python?\" `b) Make sure to make copy of this python file and then run it in the MLLifecycle directory. c) NOTE: Think it'd be wise to insert some breakpoints/places to use pdb to ensure that things run as intended. I believe it will make debugging more efficient. d) As of 11/3/25, my new problem is syncing the dates for the data. Iniiat soln consisted of using start and end parameters to specify the bounds needed and then syncing the dates that way. Before this is implemented, I need to ensure that the rest of pipeline is provably correct still so my it soln can be plugged and played. e) As of 11/6/25, the solution is nearly complte. At this point, the problem is ensuring that n companies are allowed to be entered, and ensuring that at the end, each company has its own row-tuple.  f) Everything works up until after checkpoint #2 from a provabiilty perspective as of 11/6/25 .

In next sesh, focus should be on finishing up setting up coding env programatically FIRST, and then inserting the neccessary pandas stuff, whilst simulatnatneously doing more research on pandas as well. part 2) Continued learning pandas stuff, and continued seting up code env programatically. In next sesh, continue the aforementioned process. When significant prog is made, begin inserting code related to data engineering. Also, when establishing pipeline this search query may be useful: `start chrome \"? is the relative path for a filepath in python script relative to the place it is executed?\"`. [10/24/25] part 1) Continued seting of programmatic env. At this point, I believe Subssytem2's programmatic rep should be worked on next, whilst simulataneously implementing more pandas-specific code. part 2) Continued working on programming code. Adhere to aforemetioend request for next session. part 3) Starting setting up Subsystem2's programmatic representation. In next sesh, make sure to implement a quick algo that seraches for the right table to pull from both the real-time data and the historical data, in addition to the aforementioned tasks from previous report(s). part 4) Started process for integrating external dataframes. Did not adhere to aformentioned objs directly. In next sesh, make sure to adhere to aformentioned objectives. part 5) Started wriritng logic code to facilitate optimality algo. Also worked on algo for obtaining the right attrs from the Ticker Object. In next sesh, take time to finish up Pandas tutorial. part 6) Continued where I left off. In next sesh, start testing out certain portions of program. part 7) Got the algorithms implemented, began testingg parts of program. Now, the only problem is having the varaibels reference the right columns. These places are marked with REPLACEMENT PENDING. In next sesh, go back to learning some more pandas and then work on finishing up the rest of the stuff. May be wise to jump to Time Series data chapter from Python for Data Analysis Textbook to interface with dates properly.\n",
    "# Reports: [10/26/25] part 1) Made more progress by fixing contents relative to error. Had to put the dataframes needd into the python list to be accessed later in the script. In next sesh, continue this process and addresss the 'REPLACEMENT PENDING' notes and make neccessary replacements. part 2) Added a few more things. Added nomenclature for documentation w.r.t comments, to ease the process of problem solving. Addressed a few of the requirements. part 2) Started testing other stuff. Didn't do anything related to time series learning for pandas. In next sesh, focus on learning pandas from geeksforgeeks and going through times series chapter from that textbook. Then, finish this file to integrate to model with this egnienered dataset. Also, there is an error, use code output for reference. part 3) Found some logistical issues wiht some parts. Started process of getting 2nd cond implemented. Really, want to get this proj finished by end of 10/27/25 to get a decent grade.  [10/27/25] part 1) Worked on outermost pipeline script. Going forward, working in reverse order from end of data prep pipeline to beginning to ensure that the nested function(s) and function(s) work properly. part 2) Have some issues getting condition 2. part 3) Got dataframe for condition 2. Think now I need to designate the date. Will be KEY for making decisions. part 3) Made a decent amount of progress. Used comments to update some steps that need to be taken in order to ensure smooth integartion between data prep and model development. In next sesh, continue solving problems to get data prepped for model dev. Particularly, write code that applys the subsystems iteratively to each company. part 4) got subsystem1(compA()) complete, in terms of logic. However, will be imperative to handle presence of null values and omitting them when possible. **PN: I believe it has something to do with the fact that the indices for the row tuples is date-based**. In next sesh, continue to the subsystem2 to ensure that they work logically. part 5) Started working on logic for subsys2. Noticed that I need to handle the creation of dataframe with all companies on it properly. Need to figure out how to do that in subsys2. [10/29/25] part 1) Got the class for subsy2 indented properly for testing. In next sesh, continue runnign tests to ensure that subsy2's components work properly.  [10/31/25] part 1) Started working more on model file to facilitate process for running experiments via Model pipeline. In Next sesh, continue learning more about pandas, and datetime object so you can sync up the times properly to get values lined up to get perimissible data output. Also, may want to make time working on reasons why these milestone were so late. [11/7/25] part 1) Made significant progress. Finally understanding debugging process better now. **Focus is now shifting more towards experimental setups, and creating environment to load images to web application**. \n",

Iniiat soln consisted of using start and end parameters to specify the bounds needed and then syncing the dates that way.

    "- For this experiment, we ran the baseline version of the model using our original 3-tuple settings just to make sure everything was working the way it should. The model trained for 20 epochs without crashing, and we got the full model summary plus the accuracy and loss plots. The accuracy was all over the place (sometimes at 0.0, sometimes around 0.7), and the loss values were huge and bounced around a lot too. Even though the performance wasn’t stable, the point of this experiment was to confirm that the full baseline pipeline actually runs from start to finish (which it did) and that the model responds to the 3-tuple setup.\n"

In next sesh, continue the aforementioned process. When significant prog is made, begin inserting code related to data engineering. Also, when establishing pipeline this search query may be useful: `start chrome \"? is the relative path for a filepath in python script relative to the place it is executed?\"`. [10/24/25] part 1) Continued seting of programmatic env. At this point, I believe Subssytem2's programmatic rep should be worked on next, whilst simulataneously implementing more pandas-specific code. part 2) Continued working on programming code. Adhere to aforemetioend request for next session. part 3) Starting setting up Subsystem2's programmatic representation. In next sesh, make sure to implement a quick algo that seraches for the right table to pull from both the real-time data and the historical data, in addition to the aforementioned tasks from previous report(s). part 4) Started process for integrating external dataframes. Did not adhere to aformentioned objs directly. In next sesh, make sure to adhere to aformentioned objectives. part 5) Started wriritng logic code to facilitate optimality algo. Also worked on algo for obtaining the right attrs from the Ticker Object. In next sesh, take time to finish up Pandas tutorial. part 6) Continued where I left off. In next sesh, start testing out certain portions of program. part 7) Got the algorithms implemented, began testingg parts of program. Now, the only problem is having the varaibels reference the right columns. These places are marked with REPLACEMENT PENDING. In next sesh, go back to learning some more pandas and then work on finishing up the rest of the stuff.

Added nomenclature for documentation w.r.t comments, to ease the process of problem solving. Addressed a few of the requirements. part 2) Started testing other stuff. Didn't do anything related to time series learning for pandas. In next sesh, focus on learning pandas from geeksforgeeks and going through times series chapter from that textbook. Then, finish this file to integrate to model with this egnienered dataset. Also, there is an error, use code output for reference. part 3) Found some logistical issues wiht some parts. Started process of getting 2nd cond implemented. Really, want to get this proj finished by end of 10/27/25 to get a decent grade.  [10/27/25] part 1) Worked on outermost pipeline script. Going forward, working in reverse order from end of data prep pipeline to beginning to ensure that the nested function(s) and function(s) work properly. part 2) Have some issues getting condition 2. part 3) Got dataframe for condition 2. Think now I need to designate the date. Will be KEY for making decisions. part 3) Made a decent amount of progress. Used comments to update some steps that need to be taken in order to ensure smooth integartion between data prep and model development. In next sesh, continue solving problems to get data prepped for model dev. Particularly, write code that applys the subsystems iteratively to each company. part 4) got subsystem1(compA()) complete, in terms of logic. However, will be imperative to handle presence of null values and omitting them when possible. **PN: I believe it has something to do with the fact that the indices for the row tuples is date-based**. In next sesh, continue to the subsystem2 to ensure that they work logically. part 5) Started working on logic for subsys2. Noticed that I need to handle the creation of dataframe with all companies on it properly. Need to figure out how to do that in subsys2. [10/29/25] part 1) Got the class for subsy2 indented properly for testing. In next sesh, continue runnign tests to ensure that subsy2's components work properly.  [10/31/25] part 1) Started working more on model file to facilitate process for running experiments via Model pipeline. In Next sesh, continue learning more about pandas, and datetime object so you can sync up the times properly to get values lined up to get perimissible data output. Also, may want to make time working on reasons why these milestone were so late. [11/7/25] part 1) Made significant progress. Finally understanding debugging process better now. **Focus is now shifting more towards experimental setups, and creating environment to load images to web application**. \n",

    "- In this experiment, we wanted to see if the model would still run after changing how much the data was simplified during quantization. The model compiled and trained normally, and we got the same types of outputs as before (model summary and accuracy/loss plots). The accuracy still jumped around between low and moderate values, and the loss stayed pretty unstable."
