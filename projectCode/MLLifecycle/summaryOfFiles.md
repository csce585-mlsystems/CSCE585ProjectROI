## Updated Outline for CSCE 585 Project
- The informal rep of pipeline for model is as follows: a) Time Series Data is: i) Cleaned, ii) Processed, iii) and output as a dataframe ready for model ingestion. b) Next, a custom model is interfaced[since I created the model from scratch.]. c) Next, the Time Series Data is ported to the model's environment for ingestion. d) (cont here). [NOTE: In future, a mermaid visual should be implemetned to showcase how tihs is working]
