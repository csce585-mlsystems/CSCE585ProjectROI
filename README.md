## Project Summary/Abstract  
This project is a machine learning model that helps young adults generate passive income through the strategy of value investing.
By combining financial data from sources such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and The Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED), the model will analyze value metrics such as the Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio, the Debt to Equity (D/E) ratio, and the Free Cash Flow (FCF) yield. The system will take in user input such as investment amount, desired return amount, and a time frame to generate stock reccomendations. It will then compare those recommendations to benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Russell 1000 Value Index to measure performance.

## Problem Description  
Many young adults want to start investing but don’t really know where to start or simply don't feel confident enough in their decisions to try. The stock market can seem confusing and risky, especially to beginners. Our project makes it that much easier for new investors by using a machine learning model to give users simple, data driven, and safer investment suggestions.

## Contribution  
- [`Replication of existing work`]  
- [`Extension of existing work`]  
- [`Novel contribution`]  

Please select one or multiple tags that apply. Example:  
### [`Replication of existing work`], [`Extension of existing work`]  
We use paper_1 [citation] to reproduce their results. We improve their method as follows:  
- Contribution 1  
- Contribution 2  

Note: This has no impact on your grade as long as you properly follow the procedure (e.g., problem identification, motivation, method, discussion, results, conclusion). Choosing [`Novel contribution`] will not give you any advantage over [`Replication of existing work`].  

## References  
### `BibTeX` of all references used in the project. Can be included as a `references.bib` file in the repo.

# < The following is only applicable for the final project submission >  

## Dependencies  
### Include all dependencies required to run the project. Example:  
- Python 3.11  
- Ubuntu 22.04  

For Python users: Please use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as your package manager instead of `pip`. Your repo must include both the `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files.  

## Directory Structure  
Example:  
```
|- data (mandatory)
|- src (mandatory)
|   |- model.py
|   |- example.py
|- train.py
|- run.py (mandatory)
|- result.py (mandatory)
```

⚠️ Notes:  
- All projects must include the `run.<ext>` script (extension depends on your programming language) at the project root directory. This is the script users will run to execute your project.  
- If your project computes/compares metrics such as accuracy, latency, or energy, you must include the `result.<ext>` script to plot the results.  
- Result files such as `.csv`, `.jpg`, or raw data must be saved in the `data` directory.  

## How to Run  
- Include all instructions (`commands`, `scripts`, etc.) needed to run your code.  
- Provide all other details a computer science student would need to reproduce your results.  

Example:  
- Download the [DATASET](dataset_link)
  ```bash
  wget <URL_of_file>
  ```

- To train the model, run:  
  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```  
- To plot the results, run:  
  ```bash
  python result.py
  ```  

## Demo  
- All projects must include video(s) demonstrating your project.  
- Please use annotations/explanations to clarify what is happening in the demo.
