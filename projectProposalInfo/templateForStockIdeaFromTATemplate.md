## Project Summary/Abstract  
### A short summary of the project (3–5 sentences maximum).  

## Problem Description  
- Problem Statement: Many young adults aspire to obtain a source of passive income yet do not know how to invest money. Making serious financial decisions requires conquering huge knowledge curve. 
- Motivation  
  - Motivation 1: Aspire to open up options for passive income for people. 
- Challenges  
  - Challenge 1: Due to Cloud ML, challenges include: Latency, Data Privacy and Security, Network Dependency  
- Proposed solution: Creating an AI Agentic System that contains a ML Model responsible for predicting the highest rate of return which will help users understand how to pick stocks 

## Contribution

### Novel Contribution
- Type of ML Problem: Supervised Learning: Classification
- Type of ML Used: Cloud ML
- Proposed algorithms to assist in solution: a) Linear Regression, b) Decision Trees, and/or c) Support Vector Machines. 
- Dataset(s) used: 1) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imaadmahmood/global-finance-and-economic-indicators-dataset-2024, 2) https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/390/stock+portfolio+performance, 3) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smayanj/stock-market-dataset. Dataset(s) will be used to provide accurate predictions to have the user gain the highest ROI. 
- Quantitative Evaluation:  a) Accuracy: # of times the agent is accurate when identifying an issue. b) Time: # of times the agent is accurate when providing a solution. 
- Qualitative Evaluation: a) User Experience: Want to ensure that users are given appropriate information that supports their journey in obtaining another avenue to passive income.   
- Related/Existing Solution(s): 1) [Streetbeat](https://streetbeat.com/en) , 2) [Fidelity Go](https://www.fidelity.com/managed-accounts/fidelity-go/overview?s_tnt=192066%3A0%3A0&adobe_mc_sdid=SDID%3D3A5FD1DD436AA6D6-57B7F8BD62D99482%7CMCORGID%3DEDCF01AC512D2B770A490D4C%40AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1757906167&adobe_mc_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F), and 3) [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/investing?nis=6&ch=1)

Note: This has no impact on your grade as long as you properly follow the procedure (e.g., problem identification, motivation, method, discussion, results, conclusion). Choosing [`Novel contribution`] will not give you any advantage over [`Replication of existing work`].  

## References  
### `BibTeX` of all references used in the project. Can be included as a `references.bib` file in the repo.

# < The following is only applicable for the final project submission >  

## Dependencies  
### Include all dependencies required to run the project. Example:  
- Python 3.11  
- Ubuntu 22.04  

For Python users: Please use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as your package manager instead of `pip`. Your repo must include both the `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files.  

## Directory Structure  
Example:  
```
|- data (mandatory)
|- src (mandatory)
|   |- model.py
|   |- example.py
|- train.py
|- run.py (mandatory)
|- result.py (mandatory)
```

⚠️ Notes:  
- All projects must include the `run.<ext>` script (extension depends on your programming language) at the project root directory. This is the script users will run to execute your project.  
- If your project computes/compares metrics such as accuracy, latency, or energy, you must include the `result.<ext>` script to plot the results.  
- Result files such as `.csv`, `.jpg`, or raw data must be saved in the `data` directory.  

## How to Run  
- Include all instructions (`commands`, `scripts`, etc.) needed to run your code.  
- Provide all other details a computer science student would need to reproduce your results.  

Example:  
- Download the [DATASET](dataset_link)
  ```bash
  wget <URL_of_file>
  ```

- To train the model, run:  
  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```  
- To plot the results, run:  
  ```bash
  python result.py
  ```  

## Demo  
- All projects must include video(s) demonstrating your project.  
- Please use annotations/explanations to clarify what is happening in the demo.
